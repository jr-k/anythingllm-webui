# AnythingLLM Web Console

A self-hosted web interface for your AnythingLLM instance. Built to solve the mobile/desktop pairing issues that some users experience with the official apps.

**Why this exists:** The official AnythingLLM mobile and desktop apps sometimes fail to pair correctly. This web console provides a reliable alternative that works on any device with a browser — phones, tablets, laptops, or desktops.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install flask requests

# Run the server
python server.py
```

Then open:
- **Local:** `http://localhost:1555`
- **LAN:** `http://YOUR_IP:1555` (from other devices on your network)
- **WAN:** Your port-forwarded address (if configured)

Create your first account with your AnythingLLM API key. The server validates it against your instance before creating the account.

## What It Does

This console:
- ✅ Serves a modern, responsive web UI (works great on mobile)
- ✅ Manages user accounts locally (username + password + API key)
- ✅ Proxies all API requests through the server (API keys never touch the browser)
- ✅ Supports multiple users with isolated workspaces
- ✅ Installable as a PWA (add to home screen on phones)

## Configuration

On first run, `config.json` is created with these settings:

| Setting | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `anythingllm_url` | `http://localhost:3001` | Where the **server** reaches AnythingLLM. Keep as `localhost:3001` even for remote access. |
| `listen_host` | `0.0.0.0` | Network interface to bind. `0.0.0.0` = all interfaces, `127.0.0.1` = localhost only. |
| `listen_port` | `1555` | Port number for the web console. |
| `master_api_key` | *(pre-filled)* | Optional admin key. See "Master API Key" section below. |
| `allow_signup` | `true` | Set to `false` to prevent new account creation after setup. |
| `ssl_certfile` | `""` | Path to SSL certificate PEM file (optional, for HTTPS). |
| `ssl_keyfile` | `""` | Path to SSL key PEM file (optional, for HTTPS). |

### About the Master API Key

**Completely optional** — only needed for multi-user management.

**What it does:** Grants access to the Settings page where you can:
- View and delete other user accounts
- Change server settings (URL, port, SSL)
- Rotate the master key itself

**When you need it:**
- **Single user?** Ignore it or delete it — all features work without it
- **Multiple users?** Set it so one account can manage others

**How it works:** Your account's AnythingLLM API key must match the `master_api_key` in `config.json`. To make your account the master:

```json
{
  "master_api_key": "YOUR-ACTUAL-ANYTHINGLLM-API-KEY"
}
```

Restart the server after changing this value.

**To disable master access entirely:**
```json
{
  "master_api_key": ""
}
```

## HTTPS Setup (Required for Internet Access)

### Option 1: Built-in SSL

Edit `config.json`:
```json
{
  "ssl_certfile": "/path/to/cert.pem",
  "ssl_keyfile": "/path/to/key.pem"
}
```

Restart — the server auto-detects and uses HTTPS if files exist.

**Free certificates:**
- [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) — auto-renewing
- [ZeroSSL](https://zerossl.com/) — 90-day certs
- [Cloudflare Origin CA](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/origin-ca/) — long-lived

### Option 2: Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

Run the console on HTTP, let Caddy/nginx handle HTTPS.

**Caddy** (simplest, auto-renewal):
```Caddyfile
console.your-domain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:1555
}
```

**nginx**:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name console.your-domain.com;
    
    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/your-domain.com/privkey.pem;
    
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:1555;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    }
}
```

## Image Generation

Generate and edit images through your AnythingLLM instance's configured image provider, two ways: the `/img` chat command (like the desktop app) and the dedicated Image Gen panel.

### `/img` Chat Command

Type `/img` followed by a prompt in any chat composer:

```
/img a watercolor otter wearing a detective coat
```

- **No attachments** — generates a new image from the prompt
- **Images attached** (drag-and-drop or paste) — the prompt becomes an *edit instruction* instead: `/img change the background to night` edits the attached images
- The result renders inline in the conversation with a download button
- While the provider works, the reply shows a "generating image…" placeholder — local models can take a few minutes per image

**Session-only results:** the developer API has no way to write generated images into the server-side chat history, so `/img` bubbles disappear when the thread reloads (the prompt is never sent as a chat message, so nothing is recorded server-side either). The Image Gen panel keeps the most recent result.

### Image Gen Panel

The dedicated panel exposes the full `POST /v1/openai/images/generations` call:

- **Prompt** (required) — describes the image, or the edit when references are attached
- **Size** (optional) — e.g. `1024x1024`; omitted from the request when blank
- **Reference images** — attach one or more images to switch the provider into edit mode
- **Result card** — inline preview, download as PNG, plus any provider notice

The console always requests `b64_json` so images render inline; URL responses are handled too. If the provider returns JSON with nothing renderable, the raw response is parked in the API Console panel instead of failing silently.

### Provider Support

Configure the provider in the AnythingLLM app under **Settings → AI Providers → Image Generation**. Editing support varies by provider:

| Provider | Generation | Editing (reference images) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenAI | ✅ | ✅ |
| OpenRouter | ✅ | ✅ via chat completions with image inputs |
| Lemonade | ✅ | ✅ model-dependent |
| Ollama | ✅ | ❌ falls back to prompt-only generation with a notice |
| LocalAI | ✅ | ⚠️ stock builds drop references and return a notice — [PR #6222](https://github.com/Mintplex-Labs/anything-llm/pull/6222) implements true editing via `ref_images` |

Editing also requires an **edit-capable model**. Instruction-editing models such as **FLUX.1 Kontext [dev]** handle both generation and editing through a single model; generation-only models (e.g. plain FLUX.1-dev) return fresh generations even when references are attached.

Whenever the provider can't perform an edit, it returns a **notice** with the result — displayed under the image in both the chat bubble and the panel, so you always know whether the edit actually happened.

## Security

- **API keys never leave the server** — Browser only sees chat content
- **Passwords hashed** — PBKDF2 with 240,000 iterations
- **Session security** — HttpOnly + SameSite cookies
- **Rate limiting** — 5 failed login attempts per 60 seconds
- **File access control** — Only safe extensions served, path traversal blocked
- **SSRF protection** — API key validation only against configured instance

**Important:** The master key in `config.json` is stored in plain text. Keep it secure and never commit it to version control.

## Known Limitations

1. **API paths assumed** — Uses standard `/api/v1/...` routes. If your AnythingLLM uses different paths, edit `endpointCatalog()` in the HTML file.

2. **Agent files indexed per-browser** — No API endpoint to list generated files, so the Files panel tracks them locally. If AnythingLLM clears storage, links break until you forget the entry.

3. **Plain text responses** — Assistant replies show fenced code blocks but no markdown tables, headings, or inline links yet.

4. **No per-message editing** — API doesn't support editing/deleting individual messages. "Edit" loads prompt back into composer (creates new turn). "Retry" re-sends the prompt. Only "Reset" clears thread history.

5. **Document name format** — `GET /v1/document/{docName}` expects just the filename (last path segment), which the UI handles correctly.

6. **No env key picker** — `update-env` is a free-form field because valid keys depend on your provider configuration.

7. **Deprecated endpoints intentional** — `update-users` is only in the API console, on purpose.

8. **Embed snippet URL** — Generated from `instanceUrl`. Edit the snippet if your widget is served from a different host.

9. **Multi-user mode detection** — Endpoints are always attempted; 401 errors shown as banners if not in multi-user mode.

10. **`/img` results are session-only** — The developer API cannot write generated images into server-side chat history. Chat image bubbles disappear when the thread reloads; the Image Gen panel keeps the latest result.

## Customization Ideas

Want to extend this? Here are some suggestions:

- **Per-device session partitioning** — Separate workspace chat history per device
- **Auto-refresh sidebar** — Poll or refresh on window focus
- **Cmd-K switcher** — Quick jump between workspaces/threads
- **Markdown renderer** — Full markdown support for assistant replies
- **Invite links** — Generate full URLs from invite codes
- **Per-workspace chat export** — Client-side CSV of current thread
- **Systemd service** — Run as a background service with auto-start
- **Docker container** — Containerize for easy deployment
- **Dark/light theme sync** — Match system theme automatically
- **Notification support** — Browser notifications for long-running responses

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start:**
- Check if port 1555 is already in use
- Verify `config.json` is valid JSON
- Ensure Python 3.6+ is installed

**Can't connect to AnythingLLM:**
- Verify `anythingllm_url` in `config.json` is correct
- Check if AnythingLLM is running on port 3001
- Try `http://localhost:3001` even for remote instances (server-side proxy)

**Mobile pairing issues:**
- This console IS the solution! Use it instead of the official mobile app
- Access from phone browser at `http://YOUR_DESKTOP_IP:1555`
- Add to home screen for app-like experience

**API errors:**
- Check browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify your AnythingLLM API key is valid
- Try the API Console panel to test endpoints manually
